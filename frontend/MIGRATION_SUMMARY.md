  email: "student@university.edu.tw",
  role: "student",
  // ... etc
}
```

### Dashboard Statistics  
```typescript
// REMOVED: Mock statistics
const stats = {
  totalApplications: 1247,
  pendingReview: 89,
  approved: 156,
  rejected: 23,
  avgProcessingTime: "5.2天",
}
```

### Application Data
```typescript
// REMOVED: Mock applications array
const [applications, setApplications] = useState([
  {
    id: "APP-2025-000198",
    type: "undergraduate_freshman",
    status: "under_review",
    // ... etc
  }
])
```

### Complex Form Data
```typescript
// REMOVED: Complex mock student info
const [studentInfo, setStudentInfo] = useState({
  std_stdno: "B10901001",
  std_cname: "張小明",
  trm_ascore_gpa: "",
  // ... 50+ mock fields
})
```

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

The frontend is now ready for full integration testing with the backend:

1. **No Mock Data**: All data comes from real backend APIs
2. **Real Authentication**: JWT-based login system
3. **Database Integration**: All operations persist to database
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error states and user feedback
5. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API operations
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```bash
# Test API connection
npm run test:api

# Start with safety check
npm run dev:safe

# Direct start (assumes backend running)
npm run dev
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Create test users in the backend database
3. Run `npm run dev:safe` to start testing
4. Test all user roles and workflows
5. Verify data persistence and real-time updates

The frontend is now production-ready for end-to-end testing with the scholarship management backend system.
