/**
 * Tests for `lib/scholarship-eligibility.ts:isSelectableScholarship`.
 *
 * This predicate decides whether a scholarship card on the student
 * dashboard is selectable (shows "Apply" button) or grayed out. Wrong
 * verdict either:
 * - Hides scholarships students COULD apply for (functional bug, the
 *   student misses the deadline thinking they're ineligible).
 * - Shows scholarships students CAN'T apply for (clicks lead to a
 *   confusing 422 from backend).
 *
 * The contract: a scholarship is selectable iff
 *   eligible_sub_types is a non-empty array AND
 *   there's no top-level (sub_type-less) error rule.
 *
 * 7 cases.
