/**
 * E2E spec: student withdraws a submitted application.
 *
 * Closes one of the three missing flows listed in issue #214:
 * - student onboarding
 * - **student withdrawal**  ← this spec
 * - role-permission validation
 *
 * Flow under test:
 *   stuphd001 (student) → POST /applications (phd, sub_type=nstc, is_draft=false)
 *                          → DB applications.status = 'submitted'
 *   stuphd001            → POST /applications/{id}/withdraw
 *                          → DB applications.status = 'draft' (per
 *                          ApplicationService.withdraw_application:
 *                          submitted/under_review → draft)
 *   stuphd001            → POST /applications/{id}/withdraw  (again)
 *                          → 400 ValidationError ("Only submitted or
 *                          under-review applications can be withdrawn")
 *
 * Pinned invariants:
 * - Withdrawal happy path returns the application to `draft`, not to
 *   `withdrawn` (the latter is a separate terminal state used elsewhere).
 * - A second withdrawal call on the now-draft application is rejected
 *   with HTTP 400 — not a silent no-op, not a 500.
 * - The endpoint exists at POST /applications/{id}/withdraw under the
 *   /api/v1 prefix.
