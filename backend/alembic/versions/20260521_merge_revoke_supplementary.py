"""Empty merge: collapse add_supplementary_import_001 and revoke_suspend_001 into single head.

Both add_supplementary_import_001 and revoke_suspend_001 branch from
email_tpl_scholar_type_001. They touch disjoint tables so the merge order
is irrelevant for correctness.

No-op upgrade/downgrade — alembic just collapses the DAG.
