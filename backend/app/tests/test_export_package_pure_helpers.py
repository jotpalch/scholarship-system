"""
Tests for `backend/app/services/export_package_service.py` —
module-level pure helpers + constants.

Module had ZERO test references. SECURITY-CRITICAL filename
sanitization (ZIP path traversal vector) + zh-TW label
constants that drive admin export filenames and PDF rendering.

Wave 6a143 pins the pure helpers without invoking the reportlab
font registration / MinIO / DB paths:
- _sanitize_filename: 9 invalid-char sanitization + SECURITY
  path-traversal prevention
- FILE_TYPE_LABELS: zh-TW labels for the 8 known file types
- DEGREE_LABELS: zh-TW labels for degrees 1/2/3

Skips _build_table / _generate_summary_pdf because they depend
on reportlab Paragraph + CJK font registration that runs at
class instantiation (not a pure-helper test).
