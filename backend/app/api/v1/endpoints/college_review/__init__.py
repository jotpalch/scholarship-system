"""
College Review API Routes

This package aggregates all college review endpoints:
- Application Review (申請審查)
- Ranking Management (排名管理)
- Distribution & Quotas (配額分配)
- Utilities & Statistics (工具與統計)

Note: The prefix "/college-review" is set in api.py, not here.
This allows the router to be flexible and reusable.
