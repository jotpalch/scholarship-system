"""
Prometheus Metrics Middleware for FastAPI

This middleware automatically collects HTTP request metrics including:
- Request count by method, endpoint, and status code
- Request duration/latency
- Requests in progress
- HTTP error rates

The middleware is exception-safe and will not affect application behavior
even if metrics collection fails.
